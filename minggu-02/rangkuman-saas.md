# Software as a Service ( SaaS )

<h2>What is the difference between IaaS, SaaS, and Paas?</h2>

<ul>
<li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)</li>
    Hardware, software and your application code has to be managed. You select the servers to activate (either physical or virtual), install the OS and software stack, then finally deploy your applications. Some providers offer very low-level controls so that you can build your own data center in the cloud.
