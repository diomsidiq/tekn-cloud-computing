# Software as a Service ( SaaS )

<h2>What is the difference between IaaS, SaaS, and Paas?</h2>

<ul>
<li>IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)</li>
    Hardware, software and your application code has to be managed. You select the servers to activate (either physical or virtual), install the OS and software stack, then finally deploy your applications. Some providers offer very low-level controls so that you can build your own data center in the cloud.
<li>PaaS (Platform as a service)</li>
    This type of service abstracts away all of the hardware decisions. Only the software stack and your application code has to be managed. Select the appropriate provider depending on the software stack you want then deploy your applications. The actual servers, network and storage are all taken care of automatically by the platform.
<li>SaaS (Software as a service)</li>
    This is the highest abstraction level and means you are just using a web application and never see the hardware and software stack that makes it run. You enter your own data into the application provided however some of the bigger applications allow for building custom apps on top (e.g. Facebook).

<h2>SAAS (Software as a Service) Platform Architecture</h2>
SaaS is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. Users can access it with the help of web browsers.

<h3> SAAS Architecture: </h3>
With this model, a single version of the application, with a single configuration is used for all customers. The application is installed on multiple machines to support scalability (called horizontal scaling). In some cases, a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre-release versions of the applications for testing purposes. 

<h2>Why Use a SaaS Architecture?</h2>
As a mentioned in the introduction, the software has been distributed to customers in a variety of channels over the last few decades.  The more recent distribution channel in Software as a Service (or SaaS).

<b>Consumers</b>
<pre><code>From a consumer’s perspective, SaaS products are one of the easiest ways to use digital services or products. You simply access them over the web, pay for the service and use them! In recent years we’ve seen the emergence of thousands of SaaS products targeted at consumers such as:
<ul>
<li> Netflix </li>
<li> Google Docs </li>
<li> ... and many more!</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to build a cloud-based SaaS Application</h2>
When building a (global) SaaS application chances are high that you’re building it in the cloud. The cloud has a lot of advantages – think of scalability – in contrast to local server environments.

Therefore this post, and the ones which will follow focus on software which is built and engineered in the cloud.
